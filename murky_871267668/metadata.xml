    <description>Adds three new collectibles, a new pickup, a new nightmare animation and a new playable character Murky.

Murky has the same starting stats, as Isaac and starts with the Tainted Lung item.

[b][u]New collectibles:[/u][/b]

[b]Tainted Lung[/b] adds a Rads stat, which slowly increases over time. As it increases it gives penalty to the character's movement speed and adds a chance to cough, hacking up blood and shooting multiple short ranged projectiles, instead of a single tear. When the Rads stat reaches it's maximum the character starts taking damage over time, untill it is decreased.
Rads can be decreased by picking up Radaway pickups that have a chance to spawn in cleared rooms and can also spawn from opened chests and grab bags.

[b]Pipbuck[/b] adds a meter that shows how high is the Rads stat and adds a Compass collectible on pickup.

[b]Leather Canteen[/b] is an active item, that can store up to eight doses of Radaway, which can be used on activation.

The new items only spawn, when the playable character is Murky, but the new nightmare animation has a chance to happen for any character, since i haven't figured out a way to make it character specific.

Hopefully it's not too buggy.

This mod is based on an MLP / Fallout crossover fanfiction Murky Number Seven by Fuzzy.</description>
